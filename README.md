# Voting System for A Health Award

This project is a web-based application built using React.js, designed to facilitate secure voting processes for various award cycles. The system includes features such as OTP verification through SMS, a nomination form for candidates, voting forms, and an administration dashboard for managing the entire process efficiently.

## Features
**OTP with SMS:**
The voting system incorporates a robust OTP verification process using SMS. When users register or vote, they receive a one-time password on their registered mobile number, ensuring secure access and preventing duplicate or unauthorized voting.

**Nomination Form**
The platform allows participants to nominate candidates for various award categories. Nominees' details are collected through a user-friendly nomination form, ensuring a seamless nomination process.

**Award Cycles**
The system supports multiple award cycles, enabling administrators to set up and manage distinct voting rounds for different events or time periods.

**Voting Form**
Registered users can cast their votes using the intuitive voting form. The application ensures that users can vote only once for each award category, providing a fair and transparent voting process.

**Administration Dashboard**
The administration dashboard serves as the central hub for managing the voting system. Administrators can monitor and control the nomination process, view real-time voting statistics, and manage award cycles efficiently.


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
